## Conditional While Loops

release_date = 26
current_date = 22

# Create a conditional loop while current_date is less than or equal to the release_date
while current_date <= release_date:

  # Promote purchases
  if current_date <= 24:
    print("Purchase before the 25th for early access")

  # Check if the date is equal to the 25th
  elif current_date == 25:
    print("Coming soon!")
    
  else:
    print("Available now!")
  
  # Increment current_date by one
  current_date += 1

## Appending to a list

# Create an empty list
authors_below_twenty_five = []

# Loop through the authors dictionary
for key, value in authors.items():
  
  # Check for values less than 25
  if value < 25:
    
    # Append the author to the list
    authors_below_twenty_five.append(key)
    
print(authors_below_twenty_five)


### Book genre popularity

for genre, average_sale in genre_sales.items():
    
    # Filter for the maximum sales value
    if average_sale == 5166000000:
      
      # Print the genre
      print("Most popular genre: ", genre)
      print("Average sales: ", average_sale)
    
    # Filter for the minimum sales value
    elif average_sale == 80000000:
      
      # Print the genre
      print("Least popular genre: ", genre)
      print("Average sales: ", average_sale)

## Working with keywords

# Loop through the dictionary
for genre, sale in genre_sales.items():
  
  # Check if genre is Horror or Mystery
  if genre == "Horror" or genre == "Mystery":
    print(genre, sale)
  
  # Check if genre is Thriller and sale is at least 3 million
  elif genre == "Thriller" and sale >= 3000000:
    print(genre, sale)
